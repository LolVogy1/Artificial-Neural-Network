# Artificial-Neural-Network
This is a reupload of a project I did for my AI Methods module at university. This was implemented in Python. This was done quite a long time ago so I don't remember an awful lot of it, so I included the coursework spec as a reminder.

The coursework spec is as follows:

You are to implement, in a programming language of your choice, an artificial neural 
network – specifically a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained using the error 
backpropagation algorithm. 

Once implemented you are to train your network on the data 
set provided and evaluate its performance. Note – you should NOT use numerical 
computing environments (such as MATLAB) or pre-written neural network libraries. Typical 
languages you could use would be Python, Java, C#, C++, C.

There are a number of stages to this process that will be evaluated: 

1) Implementation of the algorithm in an appropriate language; 

2) Documentation and commenting of this implementation; 

3) Appropriate data pre-processing of the supplied data set; 

4) Appropriate training, configuration and weight adjustment of the ANN model; 

5) Appropriate evaluation of the chosen ANN structure; 

6) A report detailing the above process and discussing the evaluation of the model. 

For additional marks you should contrast your ANN model with a simple data driven model 
such as a simple multiple linear regression model (for example, see LINEST in Excel). You 
should also try different ‘improvements’ to the standard backpropagation algorithm and 
report on these – for example, momentum, annealing, etc. 
The data set will be provided as an Excel file consisting of N columns. The first N-1 
columns are the predictors; the Nth column represents the predictand. You should process 
these data appropriately. This involves cleaning the data, selecting a way to split the data 
into appropriate subsets, selecting predictands, and standardising the data to an 
appropriate range.
